# Learning Node.js and Express.js

Welcome to my journey of learning Node.js and Express.js! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing code snippets, and notes as I dive into these powerful technologies for building server-side applications.

## About Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance network applications.

## About Express.js

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Node.js and Express.js, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new project and install Express.js using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install express
